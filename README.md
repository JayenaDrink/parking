# 🚗 Parking Slot Detector

A free, web-based parking slot detection system using YOLOv8 computer vision. Upload a photo of a parking lot and get real-time detection of empty and occupied spaces.

## 🌟 Features

- **Free Training**: Train your model using Google Colab (free GPU)
- **Web Interface**: Beautiful, modern web app for image uploads
- **Real-time Detection**: Fast inference using YOLOv8
- **Free Deployment**: Deploy to Render, Railway, or Hugging Face Spaces
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployment from GitHub pushes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Train Your Model (Free)

1. Open `training/train_parking_model.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Enable GPU runtime (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)
3. Run all cells to train your model
4. Download the trained model (`parking_model.pt`)
5. Upload it to the `models/` folder in your repository

### 2. Deploy Online (Free Options)

#### Option A: Deploy to Render (Recommended)
1. Fork this repository
2. Create account at [render.com](https://render.com)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Deploy using the included `render.yaml`
5. Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

#### Option B: Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces
1. Create account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)
2. Create a new Space (Gradio/Streamlit)
3. Upload your code and model
4. Automatic deployment

#### Option C: Deploy to Railway
1. Create account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Automatic deployment with Dockerfile

### 3. Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parking.git
cd parking

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` to use the app locally.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Drag & drop or select a parking lot image
2. **AI Analysis**: YOLOv8 model detects cars and parking spaces
3. **Results**: View annotated image with detection counts
4. **Real-time**: Fast inference suitable for live applications

## 🔧 Customization

### Training Your Own Model

The included Colab notebook supports:
- **Roboflow datasets**: Professional parking lot datasets
- **Kaggle datasets**: Public parking detection datasets
- **Custom datasets**: Upload your own labeled images

### Model Classes

Default detection classes:
- `empty_space`: Available parking spots
- `occupied_space`: Taken parking spots  
- `car`: Vehicle detection

### Web Interface

Customize the UI by editing `templates/index.html`:
- Modern gradient design
- Drag & drop functionality
- Real-time results display
- Mobile responsive

## 💰 Cost Breakdown (All Free!)

| Service | Free Tier | Usage |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Google Colab | 12-15 hours GPU/day | Model training |
| Render | 750 hours/month | Web app hosting |
| GitHub Actions | 2000 minutes/month | CI/CD pipeline |
| Hugging Face | Unlimited CPU inference | Alternative hosting |
